<!--
Creating a PR will check whether the pre-commit hooks
have run, and if it fails, you should do this manually.

Please see here: https://zerothi.github.io/sisl/contribute.html
on how to enable the pre-commit hooks enabled in `sisl`.

The short message is:
- run `isort .` (version=6.0.0) at the top level
- run `black .` (version=25.1.0) at top-level
