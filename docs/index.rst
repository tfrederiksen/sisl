sisl: Toolbox for electronic structure calculations
===================================================

The Python library `sisl <https://github.com/zerothi/sisl>`_ was born out of a need to handle (create and read), manipulate and analyse output from DFT programs.
It was initially developed by Nick Papior (co-developer of `Siesta`_) as a side-project to `TranSiesta`_
and `TBtrans`_ to efficiently analyse TBtrans output for N-electrode calculations.

Since then it has expanded to accommodate a rich set of DFT code input/outputs.
