    r""" Direct inversion of the iterative subspace (DIIS mixing)

    This mixing method (also known as Pulay mixing) estimates the next
    trial function given a set of previously inputs and derivatives of
    those inputs.

    Its implementation is general in the sense that one can manually define
    which values are used for the subspace. I.e. generally the subspace
    metric is calculated using:

    .. math::

       \boldsymbol\delta_i &= \mathbf f_i^{\mathrm{out}} - \mathbf f_i^{\mathrm{in}}
       \\
       \mathbf M_{ij} &= \langle \boldsymbol\delta_i | \boldsymbol\delta_j\rangle

    And then the mixing coefficients is calculated using the regular method
    for a matrix :math:`\mathbf M`.
    Generally the metric is calculated using :math:`\boldsymbol\delta`, however, by
    calling the object with an optional 3rd argument, the metric will use
    that argument instead of :math:`\boldsymbol\delta` but still use :math:`\boldsymbol\delta` when
    extrapolating the coefficients.
    This may be useful for testing various metrics based on alternate values.

    Alternatively one can pass a `metric` argument that can pre-process the
    :math:`\boldsymbol\delta` variable.

    Parameters
    ----------
    weight : float, optional
       weight used for the derivative of the functional.
       The mixer will use a weight of :math:`1-w` for the *old* value
    history : int or History, optional
       how many history steps it will use in the estimation of the
       new functional
    metric : callable, optional
       the metric used for the two values, defaults to:
       ``lambda a, b: a.ravel().conj().dot(b.ravel()).real``
